*Question 1*  

 
From: marissa@startup.com  
Subject:  Bad design  

Hello,  
  
Sorry to give you the kind of feedback that I know you do not want to hear, but I really hate the new dashboard design. Clearing and deleting indexes are now several clicks away. I am needing to use these features while iterating, so this is inconvenient.  
   
Thanks,  
Marissa

Hi Marissa,

I am sorry to hear you do not like the new dashboard design. 
These features were redesigned this way to be more coherent with the overall design.

I would suggest to perform these operations from code or the CLI, please see below from our documentation:
https://www.algolia.com/doc/api-reference/api-methods/delete-index/
https://github.com/algolia/algolia-cli

Please do not hesitate to reach to me if you have trouble using these components.

Regards,
Thomas

*Question 2*:   
  
From: carrie@coffee.com  
Subject: URGENT ISSUE WITH PRODUCTION!!!!  
  
Since today 9:15am we have been seeing a lot of errors on our website. Multiple users have reported that they were unable to publish their feedbacks and that an alert box with "Record is too big, please contact enterprise@algolia.com".  
  
Our website is an imdb like website where users can post reviews of coffee shops online. Along with that we enrich every record with a lot of metadata that is not for search. I am already a paying customer of your service, what else do you need to make your search work?  
  
Please advise on how to fix this. Thanks.   

Hi Carrie,

I am sorry to hear hear that.
Our pricing is based on the size of records and requests.
I can see that you are using our free plan which comprises 8K regards. The number of records you are trying to configure is 14K.

From what I can see from your account usage, I would advise you switch to the standard plan with 25K requests. It allows you to increase the number of records to 25K as well.

Please let me know if you would like to go further so I can introduce you to a sales person.

Regards,
Thomas

Can you fix it please?  

Hi Marc,

My name is Thomas, and I will do my best to assist you on this issue.
Could you give additional details on this issue?

I would need to understand what you would like to achieve, the indexes being used and your code dependencies.
Any relevant source code used to access our products will be helpful.
